 ## ðŸŽ¨ Color System
The design uses a warm, natural palette to reflect freshness, comfort, and appetiteâ€”ideal for a culinary learning platform:

- Tomato Red (#E94B3C): Primary action color for buttons and highlights; evokes energy and appetite.
- Golden Yellow (#FBC02D): Used for banners and calls-to-action to create visual warmth.
- Off-white (#FAF9F6) & Charcoal Gray (#424242): Provide clean contrast for backgrounds and text.





## ðŸ§± Breakpoint Logic (CSS Grid)
Responsive layout is built using CSS Grid, with grid-template areas and gap utilities. Key breakpoints:

- Small (SM < 600px):  
  - Single-column grid layout.  
  - Stacked elements for easy mobile navigation.

- Medium (MD â‰¥ 600px):  
  - Switches to a 2-column grid layout using `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;`.  
  - Side-by-side recipe cards and form layouts.

- Large (LG â‰¥ 1024px):  
  - Expanded multi-column layout with fixed sidebars or navigation.  
  - Grid areas used to define header, main, and sidebar content for clarity.

## âœ¨ Creative Divergences from the Mockup
- Enhanced Layout with Grid: Used CSS Grid to reorganize some sections into card-based layouts for clarity and visual rhythm.
- Typography: Chose a modern serif for headers to create an educational but elegant tone.
- Improved Spacing: Increased vertical rhythm and white space to improve readability on all screen sizes.
- Interactive Enhancements: Added hover effects on interactive elements for improved user feedback (not shown in static mockup).
- Accessibility: Improved color contrast ratios and added ARIA labels for better accessibility.
